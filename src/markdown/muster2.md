#### Crusade Blessings

The enemy army does not use Command Points, and is not organized into Detachments, but is considered Battle Forged for the purposes of all other rules.

Count up the the combined crusade points of each deployed player army. Since the enemy does not use normal Stratagems and we do not track requisitions, battle honors, or other crusade resources for the enemy, they gain access instead to the following special Stratagem, and a store of Command Points (equal to the Crusade Points the players bring) with which to use it.

##### Send In The Next Wave - Variable CP

*There are always more Orks.*

Whenever an enemy unit is destroyed, if it has them available, the enemy will spend CP equal to the Power Level of the destroyed unit to send it into Strategic Reserves rather than removing it from play. This stratagem can be used any number of times in a turn.

The app has a helper to handle this - when you check "Dead" for an enemy unit, the app will deduct the appropriate cost and send it to reserves. instead.
