#### Crusade Blessings

The enemy army does not use Command Points, and is not organized into Detachments, but is considered Battle Forged for the purposes of all other rules.

Looking at the list below, count up the Crusade points the enemy is deploying, and compare them to the combined crusade points of each deployed player army.

- If the enemy has more Crusade Points, players gain command points as normal for Crusade rules.
- If the players have more Crusade Points, then for every two crusade points they have over the enemy, the players lose one Command Point at the start of battle.

Basically, since the enemy does not use command points, player Crusade Blessings can go negative.
