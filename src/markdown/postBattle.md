### Updating crusade cards

After the battle, update the enemy's crusade cards in the same way as any other Crusade force for the mission that was played.

#### Out of Action tests

If an enemy unit fails its out of action test, choose whether it takes a battle scar or suffers a Devastating Blow at random. If it has 0xp, always give it a Devastating Blow.

#### Gaining XP

The players should collectively decide on one enemy unit to be Marked for Greatness and gain a custom name, if it does not have one already. If no units stood out, or several did, decide which one to nominate at random (and do not name it).

The enemy gains bonus XP to compensate for the fact that they do not pursue Agendas, and uses random requisitions. Roll below.
