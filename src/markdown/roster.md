### The enemy Order of Battle

During the game, enemy units will be given one of four Behaviors:
- Erratic units act randomly, without a goal. Don't think this makes them harmless - they'll still shred player units if they get the chance!
- Tactical units attempt to achieve mission objectives, by holding objective markers and performing mission-related actions.
- Berserk units attempt to close the distance, guns blazing, before charging into combat.
- Skittish units like to hug cover, and prefer firing at the player.

While the actual behavior is assigned randomly later, you'll first need to tell the app each unit's "Basic Behavior". This is simple: go down the list and for each unit, label it Berserk or Skittish. If you'd frequently charge with a unit, label it Berserk. Otherwise, call it Skittish. How close it needs to get to use its guns is irrelevent - the determining factor is "melee combatant or not."

The app attempts to detect if each unit can deep-strike or not; this isn't perfect, so double-check and correct any mistakes. Units that can deep-strike are twice as likely to start the game in reserves and arrive later to make your life hell.

When you're done assigning every unit a Basic Behavior and verifying if they're deep-strikers, you're ready to start a game!
