### Playing the Enemy

The enemy moves through phases the same as any other player. Use the order in the list below, moving through the units one at a time in each phase.

#### The enemy turn
If a phase has a tab in the app, use it to determine how each unit acts, moving down the list.

- In the command phase, enemy units use any relevant command phase abilities every turn they are applicable on a random relevent unit.
- The enemy does not gain Command Points as normal - instead, the enemy gains a powerful army-wide strategem each turnp If a strategem has no effect - it boosts enemy psychers and none are left alive, for example - re-draw.
- In the fight phase, enemy units choose their best melee weapon profile. If engaged with multiple player units, enemy units direct each attack at the enemy with toughness closest to that attack's strength. On a tie, they direct attacks against the unit with highest Power Level. Tiebreak again with fewest wounds remaining.
- Enemy units pile in and consolidate to engage as many player units with as many models as possible. They otherwise consolidate towards an objective if tactical, towards player units if Berserk, or towards cover if erratic or skittish.

#### Tactical Move
In the movement phase, the instructions may reference a Tactical Move. This is a special type of movement only available to enemy units.

Basically: Make a normal move, then turn it into an advance if the unit can't do anything useful (charge, shoot, control an objective) from its current location.

More formally: To make a Tactical Move, the enemy unit first makes a Normal Move in the direction given. Then, if the unit can fire at a player unit, is within 12" of a player unit, or moving further would break control of an objective, the unit stops. Otherwise, turn the Normal Move into an Advance - the unit moves an additional 1d6" (modified by any rules the unit has for Advancing).

#### The player turn
- In the player psychic phase, enemy psychers always attempt to use Deny the Witch the first time they are able. If multiple enemy psychers could use Deny the Witch against a given power, determine which one to use randomly.
- In the player charge phase, enemy characters always use Heroic Intervention if able.
