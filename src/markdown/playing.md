#### Playing the Enemy

The enemy moves through phases the same as any other player. Use the order in the list below, moving through the units one at a time in each phase.

##### The enemy turn
If a phase has a tab in the app, use it to determine how each unit acts, moving down the list. Some phases don't have a helper tab though, because enemy units always act the same way.

- In the command phase, enemy units use any relevant command phase abilities every turn they are applicable on the nearest possible unit. In addition, the enemy gains a powerful army-wide strategem. Draw a new one each turn.
If a strategem has no effect - it boosts enemy psychers and none are left alive, for example - re-draw.
- In the psychic phase, enemy units use as many psychic powers as they are able and are relevant. If a psycher could potentially use multiple powers, select one at random. They target a random valid target (friendly or hostile).
- In the fight phase, enemy units choose their best melee weapon profile. If engaged with multiple player units, enemy units direct each attack at the enemy with toughness closest to that attack's strength. On a tie, they direct attacks against the unit with highest Power Level. Tiebreak again with fewest wounds remaining.

Enemy units pile in and consolidate to engage as many player units with as many models as possible. They otherwise consolidate in-place.

##### The player turn
- In the player psychic phase, enemy psychers always attempt to use Deny the Witch the first time they are able. If multiple enemy psychers could use Deny the Witch against a given power, determine which one to use randomly.
- In the player charge phase, enemy characters always use Heroic Intervention if able.
