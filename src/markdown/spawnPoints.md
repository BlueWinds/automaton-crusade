#### Set up Spawn Points

Set up the board as normal for your mission. After determining deployment zones, but before determining who will deploy first, set up the enemy's Spawn Points. These can be outside the enemy's deployment zone.

- For each objective *not in* the player's deployment zone, place a Spawn Point near it. If this ends up inside the player's deployment zone or off the board, nudge it to a valid location (on the board, outside the player deployment zone).
- For each objective *in* the player's deployment zone, find the 'mirrored' objective in the enemy's deployment zone, and place a spawn markernear it.
- If there are fewer than 4 spawn points, figure something out until there are at least 4.

Number each one on your board, and select the appropriate number below.
