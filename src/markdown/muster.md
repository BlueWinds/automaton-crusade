### Mustering an enemy army

You're ready to muster an army for the enemy. Determine what forces the players are going to bring, what mission you'll play, normally. We've found it best to bring 30-50 Power Level of units for each player - 50 is fun, but tends to take an entire day, while 30 is much faster. Remember that in addition to whatever the players bring, you'll have an even larger enemy force to handle!

The enemy is generally capable of holding and contesting locations on the map, and performing relevent Actions, but it's not exactly *bright*. Consider avoiding any missions with objectives that are too complicated.

The enemy musters an army 33% larger than the combined total of the players. It needs the help. Feel free to adjust this up or down to match the experience and skill of your group and the level of challenge you want to face.
