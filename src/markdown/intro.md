## The Automaton Crusade
Warhammer 40k has always been a competitive game - but what if you want to play with your friends, rather than against them? Or perhaps you want to play on your own, against an automated opponent. This app can help you do so!

We present here a game variant for one or more players to cooperate against an enemy army following a simple set of rules - referred to hereafter as The Enemy. The enemy army isn't particularly intelligent, but it is extremely fun. Our group has very much enjoyed running a cooperative crusade against Tyranids, Orks and Demons. Hopefully you'll find something worthwhile here as well. Originally inspired by [The Solo Heresy](https://40k.musurca.com/40K_TheSoloHeresy_latest.pdf), by Nicholas Musurca.

While these rules tell you how to run an enemy army, they're often not completely deterministic. A game as complicated as Warhammer tabletop always requires human judgement. If something is unclear or ambiguous, use yours. Or decide randomly. That's one advantage of cooperative play - the automaton enemy doesn't feel bad if you rule against it!

These rules are written with the expectation that players will be mustering Crusade armies as part of a long-term campaign against the enemy forces. If you only want to play a single game, simply ignore all crusade-specific rules.

This app stores all data locally - there's no backend server. It remembers where you were if you refresh the page or come back later - don't worry about losing your progress. It also assumes you're using [Battlescribe](https://battlescribe.net). At the very least, you'll need to create a `.rosz` roster for the enemy. There are no ads, subscription or any of that garbage.
