#### Retinues

For each Character unit in the enemy army, choose an appropriate retinue - Hive Tyrant with Hive Guard, or a squishy psycher with a unit of infantry that can provide them Look Out Sir protection, for example. A character and their retinue will stick together over the course of the battle. If no appropriate retinue exists, a Character can remain independent, but this is naturally a dangerous proposition!

Retinues will deploy after all other enemy units.
