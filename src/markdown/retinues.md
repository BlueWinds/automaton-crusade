#### Transports

For each transport, choose a unit that can embark on it. The unit will start the game embarked, and may dismount on future turns. If the unit is a retinue, the character will attempt to join it in the transport, and disembark at the same as their unit.

#### Retinues

Enemy characters always deploy and act last.

When a character deploys, choose an appropriate retinue - Hive Tyrant with Hive Guard, or a squishy psycher with a unit of infantry that can provide them Look Out Sir protection, for example.

The character deploys in the same place as its retinue, including in reserves or in the same transport. A character and their retinue will stick together over the course of the battle. If no appropriate retinue exists, a Character can remain independent, but this is naturally a dangerous proposition!
