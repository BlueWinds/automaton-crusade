### Cooperative Play

While it’s very possible to simply play as if all units the players deploy form part of the same army, we’ve found it more convenient to treat each player as an entirely separate army - each person can bring their own secondary objectives, work towards their faction-specific Crusade rules, etc. Here are the informal rules we've developed for making this work.

- Each player manages their own Crusade force, musters their own armies, etc. Players share turns and phases - in the command phase, each player uses all their command phase abilities before together moving to a combined movement phase, and so on.
- When selecting the order to move units, fire, charge, etc., players may do so in whatever order they choose. Roughly alternating between players seems to work well, but this order is not strict.
- Players share a common pool of command points, starting with a number appropriate to the combined Power Level of the forces they bring to battle. One command point is gained at the start of each shared turn as normal.
- Units from different armies are not considered “friendly units” for most purposes - Look Out Sir does not apply between armies, stratagems apply to only one player’s units, psychic powers and auras that affect friendly models only affect those of their own army, etc. There may be reasonable exceptions, such as moving past allied units in tight spaces.
