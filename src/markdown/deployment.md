#### Deployment

The enemy deploys, and later acts, in a fixed order based on their behavior. Determine which side is deploying first, and whenever it's the enemy's turn to deploy a unit, click next the "+" to reveal where the enemy unit will deploy.

Enemy units can spawn outside their deployment zone, but not within the players' deployment zone, and not within 9" of player units. Nudge units away from the rolled location until you find the nearest legal place to deploy them, preferring to remain / move into cover if unsure which direction. If a unit spawns partially in cover, move them such that the majority of that unit is in the same piece of cover.
