### Deployment

#### Set up Spawn Points

Set up the board as normal for your mission. After determining deployment zones and placing objectives, but before determining who will deploy first, set up the enemy's Spawn Points. These can be outside the enemy's deployment zone.

The enemy always has four spawn points, numbered 1-4.

- Start with each objective not in the player's deployment zone, placing a Spawn Point on it.
- Then, if you still have some to place, locate pieces of cover outside the player's deployment zone and place spawn markers in them until there are at least four spawn points. Choose strategically for the enemy or randomly as you prefer.

#### Deploying Enemy Units

The enemy deploys, and later acts, in a fixed order based on their behavior. Determine which side is deploying first, and whenever it's the enemy's turn to deploy a unit, click next the "+" to reveal where the enemy unit will deploy.

Enemy units can spawn outside their deployment zone, but not within the players' deployment zone, and not within 9" of player units. Nudge units away from the rolled location until you find the nearest legal place to deploy them, preferring to remain / move into cover if unsure which direction. If a unit spawns partially in cover, move them such that the majority of that unit is in the same piece of cover.

#### Transports

For each transport, choose a unit that can embark on it. The unit will start the game embarked, and may dismount on future turns. If the unit is a retinue, the character will attempt to join it in the transport, and disembark at the same as their unit.

#### Retinues

Enemy characters always deploy and act first.

When a character deploys, choose an appropriate retinue if one exists - Hive Tyrant with Hive Guard, or a squishy psycher with a unit of infantry that can provide them Look Out Sir protection, for example.

A retinue will deploy near its character, including in reserves or in the same transport, and will attempt to stick with the character throughout the battle.
