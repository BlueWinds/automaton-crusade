### Set up the enemy

To begin, choose an enemy faction and create an Order of Battle for them, with the exception that they choose 200 Power Level or 6000 points rather than the normal 50. This is to represent the full roster of possible enemy units, and to provide enough power to muster an army against multiple players with variation each game.

When building the enemy list, keep in mind some of the enemy's limitations. It does not make intelligent choices. If a unit has to choose between an Invuln save or +1 attack, consider fixing this in place as the most broadly useful option, rather than trying to determine it turn by turn. It also tends to use fragile, extremely killy units poorly; you might be better off leaving the Aeldari at home and bringing Tyranids or Orks.
